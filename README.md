[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/danbelden/symfony-crud-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/danbelden/symfony-crud-api)

A skeleton Symfony3 / PHP  application, for providing a restful data storage abstraction service responsible for a single object ONLY!

# Requirements

PHP >= 5.6
MySQL >= 5.6

# Installation

This project is designed to be forked/extended to provide an internal data service, so has no installation instructions.

# Usage

You should fork and modify the entity/model/naming to your requirements...
- The the general application structure should remain relatively the same (REST)

Enjoy.
