========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/danbelden/symfony-crud-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/danbelden/symfony-crud-api)

A skeleton Symfony3 / PHP  application, for providing a restful service responsible for a single entity.

# Requirements

This PHP application requires PHP version 5.5 or greater, although may work in even weaker versions with little moddifications.
- This minimum 5.5 requirement is mainly due to the Symfony 3.2 framework

# Usage

This project is not designed for production usage; instead this is a skeleton application and should be forked.

You should modify the entity/model to your requirements, but the general application structure should remain the same (REST)
- This is a demonstrative microservice (data layer) skeleton application

Enjoy.
